## üî• AI Configuration

### CONFIGURE OPENAI

Option 1 (recommended): To use the ChatSql function of OPENAI, two conditions must be met:

- You need an OPENAI_API_KEY.
- The client's network can connect to the OPENAI website, and for users in China, a VPN is required. Note: If the local VPN is not fully effective, the network connectivity can be ensured by setting the network proxy HOST and PORT in the client.

<img width="1717" alt="3" src="https://github.com/chat2db/Chat2DB/assets/22975773/95c8a766-cc6b-4767-90e6-a8b616a89bc7">


Option 2 (recommended): We provide a unified proxy service.

- No OPENAI_API_KEY is required.
- No proxy or VPN is required, as long as the network is connected.

To facilitate users' quick use of AI capabilities, you can scan the QR code below to follow our WeChat public account and apply for our custom API_KEY.

### CONFIGURE CUSTOM AI

- Customized AI can be any LLM that you deployed, such as ChatGLM„ÄÅChatGPT„ÄÅERNIE Bot„ÄÅTongyi Qianwen, and so on. However, the customized interface need to conform to the protocol definition. Otherwise, secondary development may be required. Two DEMOs are provided in the code, the configuration is as shown below. In specific use, you can refer to the DEMO interface to write a custom interface, or directly perform secondary development in the DEMO interface.
- DEMO for configuring customized stream output interface.
- DEMO for configuring customized non-stream output interface.
